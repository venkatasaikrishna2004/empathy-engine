🎙️ The Empathy Engine
AI Hackathon Challenge 1: Giving AI a Human Voice
Theme: AI Beyond Words: Creative Synthesis & Interaction

📋 Project Description
The Empathy Engine is an intelligent Text-to-Speech (TTS) system that dynamically modulates vocal characteristics based on detected emotions in the input text. Unlike traditional robotic TTS systems, this application bridges the gap between text-based sentiment and expressive, human-like audio output by analyzing emotional context and adjusting voice parameters accordingly.

Key Capabilities:
Emotion Detection: Analyzes text sentiment, keywords, and punctuation patterns
Dynamic Voice Modulation: Adjusts speaking rate and volume based on emotional context
Intensity Scaling: Emotional strength affects the degree of voice parameter changes
Interactive Web Interface: User-friendly Streamlit application with real-time feedback
Audio Generation & Download: Creates playable WAV files with emotional speech
🚀 Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
pip package manager
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/venkatasaikrishna2004/empathy-engine
cd empathy-engine
Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv empathy_env
source empathy_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: empathy_env\Scripts\activate
Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required packages:

streamlit>=1.28.0
pyttsx3>=2.90
textblob>=0.17.1
Step 4: Initialize TextBlob (First Time Only)
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('brown')"
Step 5: Run the Application
streamlit empathy_engine.py
The application will open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501

💻 How to Use
Launch the App: Run the Streamlit command above
Enter Text: Type or paste your text in the main text area
Quick Demo: Use sidebar buttons for pre-configured emotional text samples
Generate Speech: Click "🎙️ Generate Emotional Speech" button
Review Analysis: View detected emotion, intensity, and vocal parameters
Listen: Play the generated audio directly in the browser
Download: Save the audio file for external use
Sample Texts to Try:
Positive: "This is absolutely fantastic news! I'm so excited!"
Negative: "I'm really frustrated with this situation. This is terrible."
Neutral: "The weather today is partly cloudy with a chance of rain."
🧠 Design Choices & Technical Implementation
Emotion Detection Logic
The system employs a multi-layered approach to emotion analysis:

Sentiment Polarity Analysis: Uses TextBlob to calculate sentiment polarity (-1.0 to +1.0)
Keyword Detection: Scans for emotional trigger words to enhance accuracy
Punctuation Analysis: Exclamation marks increase emotional intensity
Threshold Classification: Maps polarity to three categories:
Positive: polarity > 0.3 (Happy/Enthusiastic)
Negative: polarity < -0.3 (Frustrated/Subdued)
Neutral: -0.3 ≤ polarity ≤ 0.3 (Calm/Balanced)
Emotion-to-Voice Parameter Mapping
Each emotion category has distinct vocal characteristics:

Emotion	Base Rate (WPM)	Base Volume	Modulation Logic
Positive	200	90%	Faster speech, higher volume with intensity
Negative	150	70%	Slower speech, lower volume with intensity
Neutral	175	80%	Balanced parameters, minimal variation
Intensity Scaling Algorithm
The system calculates emotional intensity (0.0-1.0) and applies dynamic scaling:

# Positive emotion scaling
rate = 175 + (intensity × 50)  # Range: 175-225 WPM
volume = 0.8 + (intensity × 0.2)  # Range: 80%-100%

# Negative emotion scaling  
rate = 175 - (intensity × 40)  # Range: 135-175 WPM
volume = 0.8 - (intensity × 0.2)  # Range: 60%-80%
Technical Architecture
Frontend: Streamlit web framework with custom CSS styling
TTS Engine: pyttsx3 for cross-platform speech synthesis
Emotion Analysis: TextBlob sentiment analysis with keyword enhancement
Audio Processing: WAV file generation with temporary file management
State Management: Streamlit session state for consistent user experience

🔧 Troubleshooting
Audio Not Playing?

Ensure your browser supports HTML5 audio
Check system audio settings and volume levels
Try different browsers (Chrome, Firefox recommended)
TTS Engine Issues?

On Linux: sudo apt-get install espeak espeak-data libespeak-dev
On macOS: TTS should work out of the box
On Windows: Ensure SAPI is available
Installation Problems?

Update pip: pip install --upgrade pip
Install Visual C++ Build Tools (Windows only)
Use conda instead of pip if issues persist
📈 Future Enhancements
Integration with advanced emotion models (Hugging Face transformers)
SSML support for fine-grained speech control
Multiple voice selection and language support
Real-time emotion visualization and waveform display
API endpoint development for programmatic access
